ForestFire simulation

Compilation requirements:
- make and pkg-config
- A C++11-compatible compiler (specifically, the keyword 'auto' and range-based
  for-loops)
- For the visualisation: the SDL development library

Compilation instructions:

There are 3 makefile targets:
- 'make forestfire' will compile the binary 'forestfire', which is used for
  collecting data
- 'make graphical' will compile the binary 'forestfire_g', which runs a single
  trial of he simulation with text-based graphical output
- 'make sdl' will compile the binary 'forestfire_sdl', which also runs a single
  trial, but uses SDL for its graphics
